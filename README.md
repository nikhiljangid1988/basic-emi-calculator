🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my transition into data science & AI. It reflects my hands-on learning style — building from ground zero, applying real-world logic, and finishing what I start.

I come from a field-sales and banking background, and this calculator is a bridge between my past experience and future goals. It’s not just code — it’s proof that I learn by doing, and I finish what I begin.

🔮 Future Enhancements
Add a graphical user interface (GUI)

Include more financial calculations (e.g., ROI, interest breakdown)

Improve exception handling and code modularity

Make this calculator part of a larger open-source finance toolkit

🤝 Contributing
Feel free to fork the repo, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests — whether it's code, documentation, or ideas.

This project is part of my journey from field sales to data science. Not just the beginning — I’m learning deeper, building stronger, and growing with every step.
